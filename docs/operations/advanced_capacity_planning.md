  How to plan and configure system resources available to QuestDB to ensure that
  server operation continues uninterrupted.

Advanced capacity planning should be considered as part of the QuestDB
deployment to further optimize the instance performance. This page is aimed at
users who have been using QuestDB and are familiar with their data sets and who
are seeking to fine-tune the performance. Refer to
[Capacity planning](/docs/operations/capacity-planning/) for more general
resource planning.

To monitor various metrics of the QuestDB instances, refer to the
[Prometheus monitoring page](/docs/third-party-tools/prometheus/) or the
[Health monitoring page](/docs/operations/health-monitoring/).

## Storage and filesystem

### Symbol caching

### Symbol size

### Index

## CPU configuration

### High disk write rate combined with high write amplification

### High RSS value (memory consumption) on write-most loads

### High disk read rate on a small dataset
