# Insert

For ad-hoc or one-off data, you can use SQL insert statements or CSV uploads
via the PostgreSQL wire protocol or via the HTTP REST API.
For applications that need to insert large volumes of data, we suggest ILP.

Here are all your options:

* [Insert data from the ILP protocol](/docs/connect/ilp)
  * High performance.
  * Optional automatic timestamps.
  * Optional integrated authentication.
  * Client libraries in various programming languages.
* [Web Console](/docs/connect/web-console)
  * CSV upload.
  * SQL `INSERT` statements.
* [REST API](/docs/connect/rest)
  * CSV upload.
  * SQL `INSERT` statements.
  * Use `curl` on the command line.
* [PostgreSQL Wire Protocol](/docs/connect/postgres)
  * SQL `INSERT` statements.
  * Use `psql` on the command line.
  * Use your favorite tools and client libraries.
