## Introduction

Forecasting uses statistical methods and technologies to examine historical and current trends or events to foresee future developments. This can help businesses prepare for unpredictable circumstances. However, to take full advantage of forecasts, businesses must be aware of each forecasting method’s capabilities and limitations and determine which forecasting algorithm or tool would best suit their requirements.

This article discusses data forecasting tools, how time series analysis supports data forecasting, and the potential benefits for your business. Following an introduction to key concepts, the article presents a roundup of the best open source time series analysis tools for forecasting and prediction.


## What are data forecasting tools?

As mentioned, forecasting enables a company to examine past trends and its current position to prepare for what’s coming next. Data forecasting tools predict sales, budgets, and more and assist in efficiently planning and strategizing for the future.

Almost any industry could benefit from the highlighted capabilities of effective data forecasting tools. One such example is the manufacturing industry, which has been transformed by the digital revolution in recent years. Manufacturers are increasingly employing new methods to leverage the data they generate. In this context, data forecasting tools are valuable methods that can:

- increase operational efficiency (for example, by improving inventory management);

- optimize business processes (for example, by predicting the number of products that are likely to be sold during seasonal spikes); and
- uncover key insights (for example, by identifying techniques that improve customer satisfaction, leading to a boost in organizational revenue).

## How does time series analysis support forecasting?

When a temporal or time component is added to a forecast, the data is referred to as time series data. You can use [statistical methods](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/statistical-modeling-for-data-analysis/) and modeling to analyze this data, which will allow you to understand patterns and make informed business decisions. 

## Use cases for forecasting with time series analysis

Time series forecasting can be useful for identifying patterns in data for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, IoT data, auto scaling decisions, and trading. These are discussed below in greater detail:


### Predictive maintenance

Predictive maintenance techniques anticipate equipment failures so that corrective maintenance can be scheduled ahead of time; this avoids unexpected equipment downtime, improves customer service quality, and lowers the additional costs associated with over-maintenance in preventative maintenance policies. 

Predictive maintenance techniques could be a great advantage in many industries, including oil and gas, mining, manufacturing, and food and beverages. Many types of equipment used in these industries, such as manufacturing and information technology tools and medical devices, track run time status by creating system messages, error events, and log files. These data can be analyzed to forecast future failures. There have also been increasing efforts to use machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in equipment maintenance to gain more significant insights and avoid failures.

### Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection is a time series analysis technique that finds rare events or observations that stand out from the rest of the data and thus raise suspicion. Detecting time series anomalies allows businesses to better understand customer behavior and avoid unforeseen situations.

### IoT data

Most process systems in the manufacturing business, such as IoT sensors, industrial machines, and control devices, create time series data. Analyzing the time series data generated by IoT devices can provide valuable insights for your business. However, such data can fill multi-gigabyte storage in days. So, performance and scalability are essential, as is the ability to quickly examine and aggregate time series data.

### Auto scaling decisions

A proper web-server architecture is required to handle requests irrespective of whether you’re hosting a RESTful API, a basic website, or any other type of server. The scalability of your infrastructure should be directly proportional to the number of requests you anticipate having to handle in a given period. On the one hand, infrastructure far exceeding your needs is a waste of money. On the other hand, having an inadequate infrastructure means that your users will be frustrated by the speed of your service and may stop using it. 

Auto scaling does not require human input; instead, it relies on systems like time series forecasting that are essential in predicting and identifying your customers’ changing needs to scale your resources accordingly. 

### Trading 

Time series forecasting can be very useful for stock traders, as being able to identify trends in the stock market can result in more profitable trades.

Time series forecasting can be used to create AI stock trading software. AI software used in the stock market, similar to forex robots, can analyze hundreds of data points in real time and estimate all the possible scenarios for a stock's price.

## Criteria for judging the best tools

The open source time series analysis tools included in this article were judged on their ability to make predictions based on accumulated time series data. The selection was also made to cover a wide variety of tool categories: algorithms for time series forecasting—ARIMA and LSTM, open source libraries—XGBoost and scikit-learn, and data tools for time series data insights—KNIME and Facebook Prophet. The following criteria were applied to judge which tools were the best:

### Ease of Use

The chosen libraries, frameworks, and applications are all easy to use. A beginner or intermediate developer can go through freely available tutorials and use their own data to build time series analysis and prediction systems. The tools also support multiple programming languages, like R and Python, and functions for data processing and visualization, which makes it easier for developers to feed raw data, extract results, and identify patterns.

### Compatibility with other tools

The featured tools can also be used with other tools. Many are compatible with XGBoost, including scikit-learn for Python users and caret for R users. Distributed processing frameworks such as Apache Spark are compatible with XGBoost. The ARIMA algorithm is available in several languages. You can also create an LSTM in various languages, including Python, R, Matlab, and others. Open source machine learning packages, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch include ready-to-use LSTM layers that may quickly be added to models. The majority of frameworks and algorithms discussed in this article support multiple languages.

### Popularity

Data scientists and thousands of developers have consistently worked with these tools; the community has created many tutorials, written articles supporting different programming languages, created an abundance of documentation, and updated the code with better algorithms. This also makes the tools ideal for beginners.


## Roundup of the best open source forecasting and prediction tools

The open source predictive tools listed below should be easy to use, even for those just getting started with time series forecasting, and also present some useful functionality for more experienced users. As mentioned above, the community has produced extensive documentation, tutorials, and articles on these frameworks.

The following libraries and frameworks for time series forecasting will each be explained in more detail in the following sections:

- LSTM
- Facebook Prophet
- ARIMA
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- KNIME

LSTM, Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, and Gradient Boosting are algorithms commonly used to work with time series data. XGBoost and scikit-learn are open source machine learning libraries that support multiple algorithms. Finally, KNIME is a tool for data generation and processing, including some time series analysis, through a simple graphical user interface that requires no programming knowledge. 

### LSTM

*LSTM* stands for long short-term memory. It is a recurrent neural network with feedback connections and the ability to memorize. LSTM output is a result of the current input and previous inputs in the sequence. 

LSTMs can process sequences and, hence, are ideal for use with time series data. They can identify important patterns from data and discard useless information using input, output, and forget gates. Python libraries like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series) have custom LSTM layers that can be added to a model to process time series data. However, LSTMs are RNNs, which can also work with data other than time series.

To create an LSTM model best fitted for your data, you will have to identify how many LSTM cells are required. Too few or too many cells in the LSTM architecture will not produce optimal results. This can require several trials of hyper parameter tuning.

### Facebook Prophet

Unlike the LSTMs discussed above, [Facebook’s Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is restricted to time series data. It is specifically used for business time series use cases as it 
fits non-linear trends with daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality, as well as holiday impacts. 

![Facebook Prophet](https://i.imgur.com/GO1RAsV.png)

Prophet is an additive model, consisting of four separate components - trend, seasonality, holidays, and error. Hence, it works best with time series with substantial seasonal influences and historical data from multiple seasons. Prophet is forgiving of missing data and trend shifts and usually handles outliers well.

Prophet is utilized in various Facebook apps to generate accurate forecasts for planning and goal-setting. More specifically, the programming language Stan is used to create and fit models, providing forecasts in a matter of seconds. 

Prophet has been implemented in both [R](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#r-api) and [Python](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api).

### ARIMA

Similar to the Prophet, ARIMA models are also limited to time series. You can create advanced time series forecasts by explicitly catering to a set of common structures in time series data. It bases its predictions on past data values and past errors. You can tune the hyper parameters to change the number of data values used and the number of errors.

ARIMA is an acronym: AR stands for *auto regression*, which signifies that the output values are linearly dependent on their previous values. I stands for *Integrated*, which means this type of model creates a stationary time series. Finally, MA stands for *moving average*, which denotes that a series of averages are calculated from different subsets of the complete data.

The ARIMA(p, d, q) model combines the three components. In this model, p is the number of autoregressive terms, d is the number of nonseasonal differences required for stationarity, and
q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation. To be more specific, in ARIMA(p, d, q), we first integrate the time series, then add the AR and MA models and determine the coefficients.

A crucial feature here is that the time series must be normalized so that the model can be free of seasonal or transitory tendencies. We want the model to be trained on a stationary time series. 


### Gradient boosting

Gradient boosting decision tree is a machine learning approach commonly used to solve classification and regression problems. Gradient boosting is a decision tree ensemble model that learns decision trees by finding the optimal split points.

Due to its efficiency and interpretability, gradient boosting achieves state-of-the-art performance in various machine learning applications. Finding the best split points while learning a decision tree can be time-consuming. However, packages like XGBoost and Light GBM can help solve this problem.

### XGBoost

[XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/) is a fast gradient-boosting implementation for classification and regression tasks. It’s quick, efficient, and performs well on a wide range of predictive modeling tasks. XGBoost has built-in L1 And L2 regularization, which can prevent overfitting for models. It allows the user to perform cross validation at every iteration. 

As a default algorithm, it employs presort techniques. This open-source software package provides a gradient boosting framework for several languages, including C++, Java, Python, R, and Julia.

Time series forecasting with XGBoost involves first converting the time series data set into a supervised learning problem and then employing a particular model evaluation technique known as walk-forward validation; this is preferable to k-fold cross validation, which would result in optimistically biased results.

### Scikit-Learn

![Scikit-learn](https://i.imgur.com/EekMmdA.png)

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html) is an open source machine learning Python library that supports multiple algorithms KNN, gradient boosting, random forest, SVM, etc. NumPy is used as a foundation for scikit-learn. You can use scikit-learn to get started with [feature engineering on time series data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_cyclical_feature_engineering.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-cyclical-feature-engineering-py).

### KNIME

Contrary to the tools mentioned above, KNIME provides a graphical interface for users. You don’t need any programming experience to use KNIME. KNIME is a free and open source data tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It acts as a sandbox for data generation and production. 

KNIME has several preset components called nodes representing a data-processing function or actions. These include reading data from a range of sources, including Azure, APIs, Sharepoint repositories, Excel sheets, and others, applying machine learning methods, and writing data to multiple destinations.

You may create a robust, reusable data processing solution by connecting a number of these nodes in a workflow. You can combine Python, R language, and Java in the same workflow.

Hence, [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform) can be used to implement a complete workflow: from data cleaning, exploration, and decomposition to data modeling. You can employ time series components for some of these tasks, which encapsulate workflows as functions particular to time series, such as aggregating data at the given granularity, performing classic decomposition, and so on.

### Why do people use time series databases?

The above time series analysis tools require fast and reliable data sources. That’s why we need time series databases that can ingest, process, and store time-stamped data that supports forecasting.

While other databases can manage time series data to some extent, time series databases are specifically built with the mentioned qualities to effectively handle data input, compression, and aggregation over time. 

There are several options for time series databases, including InfluxDB, TimeScaleDB, Prometheus, QuestDB, Apache Druid, and more. [Quest DB](https://questdb.io/), for example, is an open source time series database that can handle huge amounts of data efficiently and can be used with popular Python frameworks and tools for time series analysis and forecasting. 

QuestDB offers an integrated method to access all your business data and provides real-time visibility into your entire stack. It also lets you capture, store, and respond to data from sensors in industrial applications. This makes QuestDB a great starting choice for time series predictive forecasting to increase your business profits and customer satisfaction.
