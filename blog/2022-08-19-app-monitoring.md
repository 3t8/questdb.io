## Introduction

Application monitoring is the process of overseeing application performance, often through data visualization tools, and reacting quickly to incidents. The goal of application monitoring is to diagnose errors before they are reported by a user. Application monitoring also enables performance and resource optimization, cost analysis, as well as technological innovation.

For instance, saving clicks made by a user can help you map a user’s journey, identify usage patterns, and pinpoint frustrations. Aggregating and analyzing over multiple user data can help identify UX bottlenecks and complex processes that are driving users away.

For the majority cases of application monitoring, log management has solved the pain points to some extent, but thrown up challenges of its own. For continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, you need continuous monitoring and observability for real-time visibility across the application infrastructure, so that you can assess the environment’s health at any given point of time. To enable this, log management tools need the following functionalities:
 
- The ability to store unlimited data as needed
- Dynamic and reliable responses to queries
- Support for real-time data streaming

This article will explain the benefits of using a time series database for application monitoring. You’ll learn tips for data collection and implementation; you'll also get to know some popular time series databases and tools.

## How do time series databases help with monitoring?

Time series databases offer multiple features that are ideal for application monitoring. They allow you to ingest massive amounts of data and improve query latency. In addition, they also provide the following main features:

- Long-term data storage: Time-stamped data can grow exponentially and requires large amounts of storage space. Time series databases are purpose-built to handle massive volumes of time-stamped data, be it metrics or events.

- Fast turnaround time: Database response time is crucial for any database, but even more so for time series databases because each query needs to aggregate large amounts of data. Time series databases use downsampling to collect less granular amounts of data over longer specified time periods; the reduced storage helps improve turnaround times dramatically.

- Efficient space utilization: Time series databases are designed to utilize minimal space while storing data physically on disks.

- Alerts for high-priority events: Saving data in a time series database enables observability across the entire distributed infrastructure. It’s easier to create real-time alerts for high-priority events using time-stamped data sets, which can either notify team members or take automated steps to solve the problems quickly.

## Application monitoring with time series databases

In order to implement application monitoring, you need to decide which data to collect and how to organize the data, in order to perform these tasks:

- Detecting anomalies
- Investigating workflows and traces when needed
- Performing root-cause analysis of critical performance issues

You should also collect and store data on discrete and infrequent occurrences to provide crucial context for understanding any changes in your system’s behavior. These could include builds, build failures, and internal code releases.

An event should carry enough information that it can be interpreted on its own. Each event record must include what happened, when it happened, and anything else you need to know in order to act.

## What data should you collect?

Time series databases allow you to store large volumes of data, but some types of data are more valuable for your purposes. Here’s how to ensure your data provides enough information and context:

- Add as much metadata as you can to each piece of data. When you look at a piece of data, you should not struggle to understand the context.
- Use optimal granularity of data. The frequency of data collection should be high enough that problems aren’t obscured due to lack of data. On the other hand, the volume of data collected should not overwhelm the database.
- Tag the scope of each piece of data exhaustively. Each metric affects multiple processes/pipelines. Extensive tagging helps you understand the full scope of a change.
- Raw data is the best kind of data there is, because you can  analyze it more thoroughly for better insights. Determine how long you need to store data in its raw form.

## Tips for using time series databases

Once you’ve decided to use a time series database and have selected the data to be collected, there are certain points you should take into consideration when choosing the right database for you. Time series workloads tend to scale faster than other types of data, so you need a database that can grow with data size without costing too much or compromising on performance. You should be able to grow, shrink, or migrate workloads easily in real time. Overall, these are the main factors to consider:

- How long you want to store your data: Some databases like Prometheus are excellent for short-term solutions where you do not need to store data for a long time. The default storage duration for Prometheus is fifteen days, and the lowest you can go is two hours. However, if you want to store collected data for a year or more, you should consider databases that support long-term storage solutions.

- What level of indexing you need for working with the data: Time-stamped data is intrinsically indexed on time, but you might need indexing on other metrics like event time, host name, or service utilized. Databases that use relational models to store data on the disks, like TimeScale and QuestDB, are easier to adapt and manipulate for indexing. Those using tag set data models, like Prometheus and InfluxDB, may be more difficult to index extensively.

- Other supported tools: Your database should also integrate well with other third-party and open source tools that you already have in your stack or that you might add in the future.

- Use interactive dashboards: Using interactive dashboards increases the effectiveness of extracting and analyzing data because humans work better with visual data. Dashboards that use graphs, charts, and infographics to display information enable you to comprehend and respond quickly.

- Understand your technology: The database architecture, flexibility, and query language used are some crucial technical factors that determine how well you use the data collected. Before you begin, you should have a good understanding of your tool stack, your query language, and the expertise level of your developer team.

Once your database is set up, the following tips can help you benefit further from your monitoring system:

- Continuously optimize: The database insert rate is critical for time series, because workloads tend to grow exponentially. Keep continuously optimizing your database with techniques like compression, downsampling, and retiring, to ensure you pay only for what you really need.

- Enable compression: Compression sounds like a basic tactic, but it can be effective in reducing storage costs, speeding up queries, and allowing you to retain more data for longer. As time series data, especially metrics, has a fixed time-value structure, it lends itself well to compression.

- Use effective querying: Effective querying is a concept many software and DevOps engineers learn when starting out but tend to overlook as they move forward. Utilizing industry standard frameworks for querying can help you predict trends and forecast future events effectively. But the data collected by you is unique. Understanding the data and getting creative with your sub-pattern or nearest neighbor queries will allow you to gain new insights.

## Time series database tooling options

There are many available time series databases and tools. The following is an introduction to five well-known options. 

### Prometheus with Grafana

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is suitable for storing fully numeric time-stamped data. This makes it ideal for storing application metrics data. Its graphic dashboard is designed primarily for [ad hoc queries and debugging](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/browser/), and console templates have a [steep learning curve](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/consoles/). You would be better off using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for data visualization. Keep in mind that its local storage is not suitable for long-term storage.

### InfluxDB

One of the most popular open source databases for DevOps, [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is designed for building scalable enterprise-wide solutions. The time series platform is equipped with a powerful API and toolset for building real-time applications at scale and a high-performance time series engine. The timestamp precision in InfluxDB can be anywhere from a second to a nanosecond.

InfluxDB is NoSQL-like in that it does not enforce a schema prior to data ingestion, which provides an easy start. However, InfluxDB has its own functional data scripting language, Flux, which can be a challenge for those who are used to SQL.

InfluxDB is also available on [Influx Cloud](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/).

### Timescale

[Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) is an open source relational database designed for storing, querying, and deleting time series data. It claims to [reduce costs](https://www.timescale.com/products) by compressing 94 to 97 percent of the data, thereby reducing the space needed to store the data.

According to Timescale, you can write millions of data points per second per node and achieve queries that are [ten to one hundred times faster](https://www.timescale.com/products) than PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and MongoDB, on account of native time series optimizations.

Timescale is compatible to SQL, and can be considered an extension to PostgreSQL. This trait means that users can enjoy the PostgresSQL ecosystem, benefiting from a wide range of tools that are available for deployment. It is suitable for teams looking for migrating data from an existing SQL database.

### QuestDB

[QuestDB](https://questdb.io/) is the [fastest open source](https://www.g2.com/categories/time-series-databases) time series database.

The tool, which offers queries via SQL for time series operations, stores its data in the form of a relational database. QuestDB open source works with on-premise or embedded setups, with a range of [ILP client libraries](/docs/reference/clients/overview) and PostgresSQL wire support to facilitate data ingestion. It integrates with tools including Grafana, Kafka, and Telegraf. If you are looking for a high-performant time series database that support queries via SQL, QuestDB is a strong candidate.

In addition, [The QuestDB Cloud](/cloud) provides an enhanced service with managed infrastructure.

### Graphite

[Graphite](https://grafana.com/oss/graphite/) is an open source enterprise-ready monitoring tool ideal for graphing time-stamped data. Data scraping and alerting must be handled by external tools. Graphite is highly reliable and fault-tolerant, and you can run it on-premise or in the cloud.

As a graphing system, Graphite listens for time-series data, and store data to a database library for rendering graphs and dashboards via their user interface and API. It can enhance existing databases with data visualization. 

## Conclusion

A time series database offers a fast, comprehensive solution for your application monitoring needs. You can collect vast amounts of data to generate insights about application downtime, peak performance, resource utilization, bugs, and other issues. With that information, you can take action to ensure maximum availability and the best UX.

The database tools presented above should give you a good start on monitoring your applications. They offer you a creative, reliable way to augment your CI/CD pipelines.
